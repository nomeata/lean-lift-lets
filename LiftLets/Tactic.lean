The `liftLets` tactic family.

The design is deliberately thin:

* `lift_lets => …` is a tactic-language host. Inside its block the user
  runs lift_lets-mode tactics, which live in a `LiftLetsM` state monad
  carrying a list of tracked metavariables and an accumulating list of
  let-decls introduced by `have`/`let`.
* The only primitive that makes progress on the proof is `tactic => …`,
  which runs a regular Lean tactic on the current main goal, checks
  that every new subgoal shares the main goal's local context, and
  tracks the new subgoals.
* `have` and `let` directly extend the declared local context of every
  tracked mvar (so a subsequent `exact h` can unify `?x := h` without
  zeta-reduction).
* At `lift_lets => …` exit, the proof term is wrapped once with all the
  accumulated let-decls via `mkLetFVars`, and the original goal is
  assigned for the first time.

A handful of convenience tactics (`apply`, `constructor`, `assumption`,
`rfl`, `trivial`, `grind`, `exact`, `rw`, `simp`) expand to
`tactic => …` plus the relevant regular-tactic argument.

The focusing combinators `·` and `next` select a single subgoal to
continue on.

/-! ## Syntax category

LiftLets-mode tactics form their own syntax category, so they don't leak
into the regular `tactic` grammar.
-/

declare_syntax_cat liftLets (behavior := both)

syntax liftLetsSeq1Indented := sepBy1IndentSemicolon(liftLets)
syntax liftLetsSeqBracketed := "{" withoutPosition(sepByIndentSemicolon(liftLets)) "}"
syntax liftLetsSeq := liftLetsSeqBracketed <|> liftLetsSeq1Indented

/-! ## State helpers -/

/-- Track a freshly-allocated mvar so future `have`/`let` extend its
declared local context. -/
def trackLiftLetsMVar (mvarId : MVarId) : LiftLetsM Unit :=
  modify fun s => { s with trackedMVars := s.trackedMVars.push mvarId }

/-- Are two local contexts equal in the lift_lets-relevant sense — same
fvars in the same order? -/
private def lctxEqLiftLets (a b : LocalContext) : Bool :=
  a.isSubPrefixOf b && b.isSubPrefixOf a

/-- Extend the declared local context of every tracked mvar with a new
let-decl.

Even *assigned* mvars get their lctx updated: we use `rootMVar`'s
current lctx as the canonical record of what's been added (so
`exitLiftLets` can recover the let-decls without a parallel state
field), and `rootMVar` gets assigned as soon as the first `tactic => …`
runs. Updating an assigned mvar's lctx is safe because we only ever
append decls — its existing assignment still type-checks in the larger
context. -/
private def extendTrackedLCtxs (fvarId : FVarId) (userName : Name)
    (type value : Expr) : LiftLetsM Unit := do
  let tracked := (← get).trackedMVars
  for m in tracked do
    let d ← m.getDecl
    let newLCtx := d.lctx.mkLetDecl fvarId userName type value
    modifyMCtx fun mctx =>
      mctx.modifyExprMVarDecl m fun md => { md with lctx := newLCtx }

/-! ## Enter / exit -/

/-- Enter lift_lets mode.

Does *not* assign `entryGoal`; that happens in `exitLiftLets`, at which
point the accumulated let-decls are wrapped around the proof term with
`mkLetFVars`. Between entry and exit the user sees `rootMVar` as the
main goal; it has the same type and (initially) the same local context
as `entryGoal`.
-/
def enterLiftLets : TacticM LiftLetsState := do
  let entryGoal ← getMainGoal
  let entryDecl ← entryGoal.getDecl
  let entryLCtx := entryDecl.lctx
  entryGoal.withContext do
    let rootMVar ← mkFreshExprSyntheticOpaqueMVar entryDecl.type (← entryGoal.getTag)
    replaceMainGoal [rootMVar.mvarId!]
    return {
      entryGoal, entryLCtx, rootMVar := rootMVar.mvarId!
      trackedMVars := #[rootMVar.mvarId!]
    }

/-- Exit lift_lets mode.

The authoritative record of the let-decls introduced during the block
is the `LocalContext` attached to `rootMVar`: every `have`/`let` we saw
has already extended that lctx. So at exit we just diff it against the
entry lctx, wrap the `rootMVar` value with one `let`-binding per
newcomer via `mkLetFVars`, and assign the original goal for the first
time.

Unassigned subgoals (from `tactic => …` calls that left open branches)
stay in the main goal list for the user to continue with *inside* the
extended context.
-/
def exitLiftLets : LiftLetsM Unit := do
  let state ← get
  let rootDecl ← state.rootMVar.getDecl
  let currentLCtx := rootDecl.lctx
  -- Decls added since entry, in their local-context insertion order.

    let mut acc : Array Expr := #[]

let-decl. The proof term we eventually build is free of any `.letE`
wrappers from `have`/`let` — those are inserted once, at exit, via
`mkLetFVars`.

introduced inside the block are carried through cleanly to the final
proof term: they are applied via `mkLetFVars` once, at exit time,
rather than being zeta-reduced into every intermediate step.
